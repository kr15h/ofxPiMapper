Projection mapping addon for openFrameworks that runs on the Raspberry Pi.

OfxPiMapper is there for people who want to use the Raspberry Pi to create standalone mapping installations. Let's say someone has 10 generative mapping pieces and gets an offer to exhibit them in an art gallery, museum or any other kind of place. 10 expensive computers? No! OfxPiMapper is here to save you!

The project started as master's thesis project by [Krisjanis Rijnieks](http://rijnieks.lv) at the [Helsinki Media Lab](https://medialab.aalto.fi/). Currently undergoing changes. Expect the API to be incompatible with your projects from the past or present-day.

Consult the [Installation](#installation) section if you are using ofxPiMapper the first time. Some of the most frequently asked questions and answers can be found in the [FAQ](/FAQ.md) document.


Features
---

The following is a list of key features ofxPiMapper has.

 - **Open Source**  
   You can use ofxPiMapper free of charge, the only requirement being adding reference to the authors of the project somewhere. Consult the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file.
 - **Simple User Interface**  
   The user interface of ofxPiMapper has been designed by keeping in mind that there is only one screen, a keyboard and a mouse.
 - **Out of the Box**  
   You can use the example project for simple projection mapping projects with image or video sources out of the box.
 - **Customizable**  
   Use ofxPiMapper as an addon and enjoy the power of custom generative sources by extending the `FboSource` class. 
 - **Undoable**  
   Since version 0.2.3 ofxPiMapper supports undo. 
 - **More to Come**  
   Expect more conventional projection mapping software features to be implemented.


Running the Example
---

You can use the example application of the addon for simple projection mapping projects where static images or videos have to be projection mapped. 

1. Put your own sources in the `example/bin/data/sources` directory. Consult the [ofxOMXPlayer](https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxOMXPlayer) documentation on how to encode your videos.

2. Compile and run the example project.  

   ```bash
cd openFrameworks/addons/ofxPiMapper/example
make && make run
   ```

3. Use the `-f` flag to launch it fullscreen.  

   ```bash
./bin/example -f
   ```


Using as an Addon
--- 

OfxPiMapper features FBO sources that allow you to create generative openFrameworks patches to be used with ofxPiMapper. Extend the `FboSource` class, override `setup()`, `update()` and `draw()` methods and then create an instance of your custom source to add it to your ofxPiMapper object.

Reuse the `example` app by copying it to your `apps` directory.

```bash
cp -R openFrameworks/addons/ofxPiMapper/example openFrameworks/apps/myApps/
cd openFrameworks/apps/myApps
mv example myOfxPiMapperApp
```


Development
---
As the projects gets a bit more popular, I see that people want to add missing features. I have a whole bunch of features that I want to add in future releases, but right now I'm trying to understand how to keep it more or less organized.

Currently for bigger planned features [A successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) by [Vincent Driessen](https://twitter.com/nvie) is used. For bugfixes and small improvements, changes are pushed directly to the `master` branch.

I'm trying to organize the project by adding future release version milestones and assigning specific issues as TODO items to them. If you notice something strange or see that there is something that can be done in a better way, don't hesitate and add an issue.

As of Release 0.2.0 some refractoring has been done (thanks [aspeteRakete](https://github.com/aspeteRakete)), namespaces have been added and we are thinking about introducing a code style for this project. Still improving on the overal structure.


Licence
---
ofxPiMapper is distributed under the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). See the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) file for further details.


Installation
---
If you don't have a clue on how to set up your Pi - go to the [Raspberry Pi website](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) and follow the instructions there. I have been using Raspbian so far as well as [Satellite CCRMA](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~eberdahl/satellite/) without problems.

Another thing you need is a working [openFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc) installation. Follow the guide to set up your Raspberry Pi.
 
 - [Raspberry Pi oF Setup Guide](http://openframeworks.cc/setup/raspberrypi/Raspberry-Pi-Getting-Started.html)

Clone this (the ofxPiMapper) repository into your `openFrameworks/addons` folder. If your openFrameworks installation on the Pi resides in the home directory, you have to type the following in the terminal:

```bash
cd ~/openFrameworks/addons
git clone https://github.com/kr15h/ofxPiMapper.git
```

Dependencies
---
Before moving on, make sure that you have all the dependencies installed. 

 - ofxGui (available in oF by default)
 - ofxXmlSettings (available in oF by default)
 - [ofxIO](https://github.com/bakercp/ofxIO)
 - [ofxOMXPlayer](https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxOMXPlayer)

To install dependencies, `cd` into `openFrameworks/addons` directory and execute the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxOMXPlayer.git && git clone https://github.com/bakercp/ofxIO.git
```

And you are good to go!


First Test
---
To test the addon, you will have to compile and run it:

```bash
cd ~/openFrameworks/addons/ofxPiMapper/example
make && make run
```

After it compiles, run it with either `make run` or `./bin/example`. You can exit the application by pressing `ESC` or `Ctrl + C`.

It will take a while first (not so long on the RPi 2), but once it runs, press 1, 2, 3 and 4 keys to switch between modes of the software. Switch to mode 3 at first to select a surface. Afterwards you will be able to edit the texture mapping of it in mode 2 and choose a source in mode 4. Mode 1 is the presentation mode. It is activated on start by default.

Usage
---
Right now a keyboard and a mouse has to be used in order to do the mapping with ofxPiMapper.

### Modes

PiMapper has 4 modes:

1. Presentation mode
2. Texture mapping mode
3. Surface editing mode
4. Source assignment mode

You can access these modes by pressing 1, 2, 3 or 4 respectively.

#### Presentation mode

This mode is activated once the application starts up. It does not show anything else except the final projection mapping as it was saved previously.

#### Texture mapping mode

In this mode you can adjust the texture coordinates of the surface you have selected in the surface editing mode.

#### Surface editing mode

Here you can select, move and distort the surfaces you have created.

#### Source assignment mode

After you select a surface in surface editing mode, activate this mode to be able to choose a source for the surface. Afterwards you might want to go to the texture mapping mode to adjust texture coordinates.

### Other shortcuts

These other shortcuts that you can use while using the example app. Remember that you can assign your own by editing the app.cpp file.

Key | Function
:--- | :---
i | Show info
t | Add triangle surface
q | Add quad surface
f | Toggle fullscreen
s | Save composition
z | Undo
BACKSPACE | Delete surface


Compatibility
---
Tested with openFrameworks 0.9.0 (OS X and Raspbian Jessie Lite). It works.
```
TODO: Add a matrix with oF versions and OS's ofxPiMapper is tested on.
```
